/* The return value from this script should be an HTML form (minus the
 * <form> tags and submit button) in a single string.
 *
 * The form will be shown to the user during install
 *
 * This example presents an HTML form to the user with two input fields
 * (you can have as many as you like).
 *
 * The user's entries in the form's input field(s) will be available
 * in any php resolvers with $modx->getOption('field_name', $options, 'default_value').
 *
 * You can use the value(s) to set system settings, snippet properties,
 * chunk content, etc. based on the user's preferences.
 *
 * One common use is to use a checkbox and ask the
 * user if they would like to install a resource for your
 * component (usually used only on install, not upgrade).
 */

/* This is an example. Modify it to meet your needs.
 * The user's input would be available in a resolver like this:
 *
 * $changeSiteName = (! empty($modx->getOption('change_sitename', $options, ''));
 * $siteName = $modx->getOption('sitename', $options, '').
 *
